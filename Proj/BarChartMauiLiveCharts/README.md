### BarChartMauiLiveCharts

BarCharts example using LiveCharts library.
The example creates 'fake' values (one value for every day of the last 4 years - can be e.g. daily energy-consumption ) and visualizes these data in the form of grouped BarCharts.
It can be switched between the representation over different time-periods (week, month, year) to represent the differences between the compared periods.
 
This is still work in progress.
