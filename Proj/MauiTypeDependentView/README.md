### MauiTypeDependentView

Navigate to a DetailPage, change Data and return changed Data to the parent page.
Uses Binding of data received from the parent page to a XAML CollectionView 
and displays diefferent dataTypes with different controls (for string, bool, datetime)

This is still work in progress.
